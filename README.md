<h1>Calendar Assistant</h1>
The calendar assitant is a smart agent that can create events in your google calendar.

<h2>Current Functionality</h2>
The agent has a conversation with the user to understand the details of the event the user wants to create. It then calls the google calendar API to create this event.

<h2>Future Plans</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The agent can find the event details requested by the user's description</li>
  <li>The agent can delete and edit events already in the calendar</li>
  <li>Ability to add recurring events and all day events</li>
  <li>Before creating an event the agent checks for clashes with other events and alerts the user if so</li>
</ul>
