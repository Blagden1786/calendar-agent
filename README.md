<h1>Calendar Assistant (CalA)</h1>
The calendar assitant (CalA) is a smart agent that can create events in your google calendar.

<h2>Current Functionality</h2>
<h3>Conversational AI</h3>
The user can have a conversation about their calendar with CalA. It can go and find events and summarise them for the user.

<h3>Create Events</h3>
The user can ask CalA to create and event in the calendar. It can include a description and/or a location.

<h3>Delete Events</h3>
The user can ask CalA to delete an event by describing it. CalA will find the event, confirm it has found the correct one with the user and then delete it.

<h2>Future Plans</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ability to add recurring events and all day events</li>
  <li>Before creating an event the agent checks for clashes with other events and alerts the user if so</li>
</ul>
